This game is simple implementation of a Memory Game.

It includes 4 coloured tiles ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ and **n Levels**. In Level1, one tile is blinked in which the user has to remember that tile and should click on it. In Level2, 2 tiles are blinked and in the same order user should click on that pattern. For rest of **(n-2) Levels**, the number of tiles has to be remembered increases linearly leaving the user in difficulty. If a wrong pattern is clicked by user, the game ends and restarts from Level1.
